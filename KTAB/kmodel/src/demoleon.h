    // These actors have an idea of how good each policy is
    // for them, as determined by their gradient vector, but
    // they have no ideal position: utility = dot(grad, position),
    // so they want as much of the goods as they can get - and less of the bads.
    // 
    // They have different capabilities to lobby for things they
    // care about, as expressed in their capability vector.
    //
    // With scalar cap, their proportional vote for P1 over P2 would be the following:
    //
    // vk(P1:p2) = c * ( dot(g,P1) - dot(g,P2)) 
    //           = c * sum_k (gk*p1k - gk*p2k)
    //
    // This would be quite reasonable behavior, but it would not exerise the SW interfaces.
    //
    // We use vector capabilities, so that they can only react to each component
    // within their capability limit. This requires estimating separately
    // the value of each provision, in the context of the whole proposal.
    // They then exert influence on each provision separately, which sums
    // to their total "vote".
    //
    // Note that this voting rule can not be represented as a function of the
    // difference in overall utilities. If two policies differ only on a dimension for
    // which they lack capability, they exert zero influence (vote=0) even though
    // there is a big utility difference. If two other policies differ by just as 
    // much utility on a dimension for which they have ample capability, they may
    // exert strong influence. Same (delta-Util) input, but different (influence)
    // outputs: no function can do that.
    //
    // Note well: this voting scheme can do stupid things. If u(ep1)>u(ep2) overall,
    // but the only dimension on which the actor happens to have influence is one
    // where ep2 is better, then the actor will oppose ep1 overall.
    // Maybe this would be a good model of actors who just do what they can
    // on each aspect separately. Such actors might well oppose (on narrow grounds)
    // a policy which would in fact benefit them (on broad grounds).
    // Hence, I flip the sign in those cases. Either way, it's just a demo.
    //
    // The point is NOT to demonstrate a realistic model of either economic
    // bargaining or vector-capabilities, because this one certainly is not,
    // but to show that we are not locked into either SMP or scalar-capabilities.
