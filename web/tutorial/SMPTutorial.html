<h2 class="mume-header" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>KAPSARC Toolkit for behavioral analysis (KTAB) is an open source platform for building models to allow the systematic and rigorous analysis of Collective Decision-Making Processes (CDMPs). KTAB is under continual development by KAPSARC to meet the need for widely available, state- of-the-art, supported, and open source software that facilitates the modeling and analysis of collective decision making. The software libraries and source code for KTAB are released on github1 as open source under the MIT license.<br>
CDMPs are those in which a group of individual actors interacts to arrive at a single decision. In both general and technical parlance, CDMPs may be termed bargaining or negotiating. To avoid confusion with legacy interpretations of these words we adopt the term CDMP, but the general meaning remains the same. The deliberations of a corporate board, the internal debates of ruling parties, the voting of electorates, and the haggling between seller and buyer at a market stall can all be viewed as CDMPs, albeit with different actors operating according to different rules. KTAB is intended to support reasonable analyses of the potential outcomes of CDMPs involving a range of modeled groups. In any group, the actors hold different values, positions, and views, which they bring to the CDMP.<br>
KTAB is intended to be a platform that contains a number of models that can simulate CDMPs. The initial model that has been instantiated in KTAB is called the Spatial Model of Politics (SMP). The class of models represented by the SMP has a long history in the academic discipline of political science. More detail on the SMP, and references to the appropriate literature, can again be found in articles available for download on the main KTAB page. The majority of the development team&#x2019;s current efforts are focused on producing a GUI for the SMP. The official version with a working GUI is now available for download.</p>
<h2 class="mume-header" id="spatial-model-of-politics">Spatial Model of Politics</h2>

<p>The initial model that has been instantiated in KTAB is called the Spatial Model of Politics (SMP). The class of models represented by the SMP has a long history in the academic discipline of political science. The key distinguishing feature of the SMP is that the model assumes that positions can be arrayed along a linear, spatial dimension (usually a single line).<br>
Fundamentally, this implies that differences in position, or advocacy, can be ordered along a position spectrum. Differences in actors&#x2019; advocacy (their position) reflect the ordering and magnitude of the political difficulty in moving from one position to another. The &#x201C;space&#x201D; between two points on the line measures the level of difference between two positions.<br>
A non-spatial approach has also been implemented in KTAB. We call this the Enumerated Model of Politics (EMP).</p>

<p>1- Download the latest SMP version for the Mac OS X from the KTAB official GitHub page <a href="http://kapsarc.github.io/KTAB/">http://kapsarc.github.io/KTAB/</a>.<br>
2- Extract the contents of the .zip archive to your PC, maintaining the directory structure in the archive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> to use the smpc and smpDyn from the downloaded bundle you need to access the contents of the KTAB_SMP bundle. You will find both the smpc and smpcDyn executables in the bundle folder KTAB_SMP.app/Contents/MacOS/</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="building-from-source-for-linux">Building from source for Linux</h4>

<p>Once we have configured and installed all the dependencies. the easiest way to build KTAB on Linux is to run the scripts located in the home directory of KTAB. These are <code>clean.sh</code>, <code>reconfig.sh</code>, and <code>build.sh</code> &#x2013; they should be run in this order to rebuild all the libraries and models for KTAB.</p>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="changing-the-working-directory">Changing the working directory</h3>

<p>The home directory will store your default model outputs. To change your home directory, go to<br>
<code>File &gt; Change Home Directory</code></p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="output-log-options">Output Log Options</h3>

<p>You can save the model log output in different ways by indicating which logging option you prefer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Default &#x2013; Records the SMP model log in a timestamp-named file.</li>
<li>Custom - Records the SMP model log in a specific file / location.</li>
<li>None - Disable output logging of the SMP model run.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="configuring-database">Configuring Database</h3>

<p>You can set the database configuration to either record your model output in SQLite or PosgreSQL databases from<br>
<code>File &gt; Configure Database</code></p>
<p>or from the database icon: <img src="pics/database.png" alt="drawing" width="30" height="25"></p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="minimum-logging">Minimum logging</h3>

<p>Minimum logging allows the user to limit database logging. Checking this disables logging except for: model / data information. You can find the Minimum Logging checkbox within the Model Parameters panel</p>
<p align="center">

<p>Note: If you need complete database output for more advanced data analysis, you should keep this option unchecked.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="model-parameters">Model Parameters</h3>

<p>The KTAB version of the Spatial Model of Politics is highly parameterized, with many options that can be set to model collective decision-making processes based on your understanding of how actors behave. We briefly describe the parameters that users can modify without modifying the source code. These parameters can be set either in the GUI application, or stored in an xml-format input file. As previously mentioned, the following descriptions of the model parameters assume a detailed understanding of the SMP model as instantiated in KTAB.<br>
The default value for each model parameter is highlighted in blue in the descriptions below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VictoryProbModel</strong> controls the rate at which the probability of a coalition supporting an option<br>
winning against the coalition proposing it increases as the strength ratios increase. This is part of the Probabilistic Condorcet Election. If Binary is used, the result is the Deterministic Condorcet Winner.</li>

<p>The affinity matrix is currently unused in the model; it is a placeholder for intended future development of the algorithm.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="data-inputs">Data Inputs</h3>

<p>KTAB SMP uses two main data input formats: Comma Separated Value (CSV) files and Extensible Markup Language (XML) files. We assume in this tutorial that the user understands how to obtain appropriate data.<br>
You can find CSV and XML templates in the <code>KTAB_SMP\sample_data</code> folder for the Windows release folder or you can find it in the official KTAB folder of the main GitHub repository under <code>KTAB\examples\smp\doc\</code> These templates show how a proper CSV or XML file input is structured for a KTAB SMP input.<br>
The Database file .db is another type of input, holding data from a previously-run model.</p>
<h3 class="mume-header" id="actor-data-description">Actor data description</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>&#x201C;Actor&#x201D;</strong> data that represents an individual, institution or group (Note: actor must be no longer than 25 characters).</li>
<li><strong>&#x201C;Description&#x201D;</strong> A description of the actor (Note: description must be no longer than 256 characters).</li>
<li><strong>&#x201C;Influence&#x201D;</strong> The relative power, or political clout, for the actor.</li>
<li><strong>&#x201C;Position&#x201D;</strong> The stated position an actor advocates for the specified dimension; this value must<br>
be between 0 and 100.</li>

<p>On the chart, you can click on the line to toggle the name of the actor and you can also zoom in/out to change the chart scale.<br>
When you double click on an actor&#x2019;s line, changing position for a specific turn, a small dialogue box will appear explaining why the actor&#x2019;s position changed for that turn.</p>
<h4 class="mume-header" id="effective-power-landscape-stacked-bar-chart">Effective Power Landscape (Stacked Bar Chart)</h4>

<img src="pics/BarChart.png" alt="bar_chart" width="500" height="270">
<br>
<p>The bar chart displays the effective power landscape, showing the effective power and positions of actors for each turn.<br>
Similar to the line chart, in the actor&#x2019;s controls on the right, you can focus or unfocus bars through the checkboxes for the actors. You can also switch between dimensions from the &#x201C;Dimensions&#x201D; section. For the stacked bar chart, you can change the number of bars displayed by modifying &#x201C;No. of Bars&#x201D;.</p>

<h5 class="mume-header" id="bar-chart-scale-potions">Bar chart scale potions</h5>

<p>You can change the scale options to automatic, max, or user defined.</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x201C;Automatic&#x201D; is the default scaling for the bar-chart where the height of the y-axis is responsive and automatic in each turn.</li>
<li>The &#x201C;Max&#x201D; option locks the y-axis on a fixed max scale.</li>
<li>The &#x201C;User-defined&#x201D; option enables the user to define the max value for the y-axis.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mume-header" id="quad-map">Quad Map</h4>

<p>You can enable the Quad Map view from <code>View &gt; QuadMap</code><br>
The Quad Map plots the change in utility to both the initiator (y-axis) and receiver (x-axis) expected as a result of a challenge from a specified initiator to at least one other actor.<br>
There are four ways to compute the perspective from which the utility changes are computed:</p>
<p><strong>Initiator:</strong> All computations performed from the perspective of the initiator.<br>
<strong>Receiver(s):</strong> All computations performed from the perspective of each receiver selected for plotting.<br>
<strong>Objective:</strong> The utilities for the initiator are computed from their perspective, and the utilities to each receiver are computed from their own perspective.<br>
<strong>Other:</strong> All utilities are computed from a specified third party.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<br>
<p align="center">
<img src="pics/quadmap.png" alt="quad" width="550" height="450">
</p>
<br>
<p>The quad map is named as such because the plane is divided into four quadrants, between which the behavior of receivers can be expected to consistently vary. In the first (green) quadrant, both the initiator and receiver can expect to gain utility from a challenge. Hence, actors in this quadrant may be expected to cooperate. The second (red) quadrant contains the cases where the initiator is expected to gain utility, while the receiver is expected to lose. There is likely to be conflict between actors in this quadrant. In the grey third quadrant, both actors would expect to lose utility from a challenge, so it&#x2019;s unlikely any would be made. The last (yellow) quadrant contains cases where the initiator would be expected to lose utility, but the receiver would gain. Again, it&#x2019;s highly unlikely any challenge would be made. You can check the auto-scale option to change the scaling to focus on where the actors are scattered on the Quad Map.</p>

<h3 class="mume-header" id="advanced-visualizations">Advanced Visualizations</h3>

<p>As of version 1.4, the SMP application includes a new visualization dashboard that opens in your favorite browser window (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). This dashboard currently includes Line and Bar plots included in the SMP application. However, the dashboard includes an additional feature for the actor movements and the Network Diagram that displays the bargains happening between the actors as a directed network diagram. We also have plans to improve the current visualizations to make them more interactive and give you more control over the look and feel. Please note that, though the visualization dashboard opens in a browser, there is no online content, and no data is sent off your computer. The plots are all drawn using the most popular and powerful open-source set of JavaScript visualization libraries, called &#x201C;D3&#x201D; (Data-Driven Documents).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Important Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>You will have to load a database file of a previous SMP run into the dashboard to visualize your data.</li>
<li>The database file has to be less than 1.5GB as of KTAB-SMP V1.4.</li>
<li>This dashboard is separate from the visualizations within the SMP application.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To open the visualization dashboard, you can either click on the Open Visualization menu item, or the visualization button from the tool bar</p>
 <p align="center">
<img src="pics/visbutton.png" alt="viz" width="450" height="70">
</p>
<p>After the browser is launched click on the Browse button to load your database file</p>
<p>A dashboard will appear a few seconds after the data is loaded, showing you the currently available visualizations.</p>
