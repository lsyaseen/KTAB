// We try to handle matrices and vectors in such a way
// as to minimize transpositions.
// The KMatrix u_ij is the utility to actor i of the position held by actor j.
// If p_j is a column-vector of the probabilities of each position being
// the actual outcome of this state, then  e = u*p is the column-vector
// of expected value to each actor, e_i.
// With that same u matrix, suppose w_j is the row-vector of
// the effective weights of each actor in this state, then
// z = w * u is the row-vector of weighted sums of utilities.
// Hence, we always treat u_ij, p_i, e_i, w_j, and z_j as
// matrix, c-vec, c-vec, r-vec, and r-vec respectively.
//
// Notice that we declare operators at the very end, outside the namespace.
